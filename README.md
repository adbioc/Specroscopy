# Spectroscopy
## The first input in this repository is CD (Circular Dichroism) - the spectral data is from Raja's (Prof. Raja Banerjee,MAKAUT )lab
- I plan to introduce different data science issues linked to spectroscopy
- The CD tour provides a case study 
- TFE is fluorinated alcohol 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol 
- It has been implemented for many decades now in conformational studies of proteins and peptides
- In peptides, which are often disordered in aqueous solutions, TFE acts as secondary structure stabilizer
- Primarily induces an Î± -helical conformation.
- In this CD tour we will see that. 
- How TFE addition at various percentages can lead to isosbestic point is illustrated 
- Also illustrated is, how thermodynamic parameters can be derived 
- We will keep the publication related info updated 
- Enthalpy entropy compensation in structural transition is another intriguing observation
